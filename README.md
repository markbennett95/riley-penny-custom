# Custom Dual OD - Riley Penney

Custom dual drive in a 1590BB - Called the "Chinook Overdrive", it features a Zendrive on one side, and a modified BD-2 on the the other.

## v1.0.0-build
1590BB encl. Works with `1590BB-2` of the [Dual Effect Order Switching Board](https://github.com/markbennett95/dual-effect-order-switching-board). Zendrive schematic is unchanged, using the "version" switch and a DG412. The BD-2 is heavily modified from the original; It features an active baxendall 2-band tone stack, and a gyrator-based 3-way "Mids" switch. Some zener diodes were added in the feedback path of the second gain stage, which went a long ways in cleaning up some of the fizziness inherent in the original version.
